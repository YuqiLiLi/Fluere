# FLUERE: Intelligent Traffic Optimization System

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for an Intelligent Traffic Optimization System, designed to alleviate urban traffic congestion and enhance emergency vehicle response times. The system integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Fog Computing, and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies.

## Features
- **Dynamic Traffic Flow Optimization**: Utilizes real-time traffic data to optimize road usage and reduce congestion.
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Implements algorithms to detect emergency vehicles and provide them with priority routing.
- **Intelligent Lane Change Recommendations**: Offers real-time lane change suggestions to improve traffic distribution and safety.

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of three main components:
- **SDN Control Layer**: Manages the network flow and dynamically adjusts traffic routes using POX controller.
- **Fog Computing Layer**: Processes traffic data at key intersections to minimize latency and improve decision-making speed.
- **V2X Communication Layer**: Facilitates the exchange of traffic information between vehicles and road infrastructure.

## Technologies Used
- **Mininet-WiFi**: For simulating wireless network topologies.
- **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)**: For generating realistic urban traffic scenarios.
- **POX**: An open-source development platform for Python-based Software Defined Networking (SDN) control applications.
